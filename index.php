		<h1>Why Philippines?</h1>

			<h2>1. Summer Weather in the Philippines Almost All-year</h2>
			<p>If you’re craving for the rays of the sun to kiss your skin, the Philippines is your dream paradise. As a tropical country, the Philippines only has two seasons: dry and rainy seasons.</p>
			<p>The dry season covers November to May while the rainy season is usually from June until October. During the rainy months, it’s still sunny and warm so tours in the Philippines are still ongoing with cancellations only necessary when there’s a typhoon.</p>
			<p>The warmest months are during the summer season in the Philippines, covering the months of March, April, and May. Island and beach destinations in the Philippines such as Boracay, Palawan, and Cebu are best enjoyed during the summer season. </p>

			<h2>2. Friendly and Warm Filipinos</h2>
			<p>Aside from the picturesque spots in the Philippines, the warmth and hospitality of the Filipinos is a reason itself for you to visit the country. It continuously tops surveys on friendliness and was even considered as the friendliest country in Asia. The moment your plane lands here, you will be greeted with the genuine and loving smiles of Pinoys. </p>
			<p>Communicating is not a problem too. The majority of Filipinos speak and understand the English language, making it a truly convenient place for foreign visitors.</p>
			<p>You need not worry about getting lost and asking questions on the road because Filipinos will guide you. You will most likely gain a lot of Filipino friends during your trip and they may just be the reason for you to come back. </p>
			<p>Filipinos are very hospitable too. They have strong family ties as part of their culture. If you have Filipino friends who invite you to their home, they will treat you like you’re a part of their family and may even serve you a feast of home-cooked Filipino food.</p>
